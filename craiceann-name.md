## Craiceann -- a note on the repo name

The name "Craiceann" comes from the Irish word for "skin" or "surface" and it's pronounced "Crackin".  
"Craic" is pronounced "crack" and it generally refers to "a real fun gathering".
https://www.craiceann.com/ is a bodhran workshop on Innis Oirr where people from all over the world gather to learn how to play the Irish hand drum. 
Since this repo is about how cracks form and grow in ice, and should be a real good time to contribute to, seemed like a good name for it.
